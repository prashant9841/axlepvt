						<p class="title"><b>ICONOGRAPHY</b></p>
						<p>Our minds hold millions of visual images. Iconography is the interpretation of those symbols, themes, compositions – and their details. While including identification, classification, and interpretation of images, symbols, and themes, it explores where and when they relate to professional, cultural, and social values. The iconographic ingredient endures long after the formulation of words has dimmed. We have an eye for professionalism. We have an eye for class. We have an eye for creative design.</p>
