					<p class="flow wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay=0.3s>The term ‘web design’ normally clarify it as a designing  process of a website including writing mark up that relates to the front-end i.e. client side design. Web design encircles many different adroitness and principles in the production and maintenance of websites. Web design, slightly overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web design include web graphics design, interface design, authoring, that incorporates standardised code and proprietary software, user experience design and SEO. </p>

						In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique. But, to create the complex designs, web designers had to work through a lot complicated table structures or even use blank spacer. Struggling every difficulties in 1996, designers developed Flash (Future splash). Yet; as flash required a plug-in so, in the fear of limiting their market share due to of compatibility, developers avoided using it. The race up to 2000 was really tough. The term like HTML, CSS, W3C were discovered but putting them in right place and gaining good outcome was really perplexing.   
					</p>
					<p>						
						Apart from all those  unaccommodating situations; 2000 was waiting for a big change for web world. Microsoft released Internet Explorer for Mac; this was important as  it was first browser that fully support HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, rising the bar in terms of standards compliance. The 21st century has become more cohesive  into people’s life. The technology was moving on with speed of time. The W3C has released new standards for HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3) , as well as new Java script ANI’s, each as a new but individual standard. While  HTML5 is used to refer to the new version of HTML and some of the Java script ANI’s, it has become common to use  it to refer to the entire suite of new standards.
