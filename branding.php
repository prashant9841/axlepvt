					<p><b>BRAND STANDARD GUIDELINES</b></p>
					<p>Cohesion. Consistency. Maintaining a level of value and excellence. </p>
					<p> These are reasons for creating an explicit standard with a full brand description of what that brand stands for. The use of specific colors, typographical elements, image styles and dimensions generates confidence with consistency of tone. A company’s vision is reflected in the handling of its brand; therefore, it is imperative to avoid discrepancies in brand elements. Effective use of brand expression avoids physical deviations from the true character of the brand, and reminds people that behind that brand is a company inviting confidence and trust. </p>

					<p><b>STORY DEVELOPMENT</b></p>
					<p>Everyone likes a good story. Developing and sharing a company’s story and its service environment fortifies a brand, amplifies its strengths, and aids in reaching a target audience. The story, or plot, includes all services offered, and follows that service path from start to finish. Building a story identity, anecdotal or yarn-like in nature, helps commercialize products – resulting in increased customer loyalty.</p>		
					
					<p><b>VALUE PROPOSITION</b></p>
					<p>TIn short: Value = Benefits – Cost <br> A value proposition explains the benefits a company provides, and how it accomplishes that uniquely well. It describes the target buyer, the problem a product or service addresses, and provides a promise of value to be delivered. Why should someone buy a product or use a service? Based on a review and analysis of benefits, costs, and the value an organization can deliver, a value proposition summarizes value to be delivered.</p>	
					
					<p><b>BRAND ARCHITECTURE</b></p>
					<p>The construction of a brand is an integrated process – establishing brand options and their relationships in today’s competitive environment. Brand architecture is the structure of brands within an organizational entity, and clearly defines the relationships between those brands. It is a type of anatomy delineating how brands within a portfolio are related to, or differentiated from, one another. Brand architecture reinforces the core purpose of sub-brands and the corporate brand to which they belong.</p>
