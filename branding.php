						<p class="title"><b>BRAND STANDARD GUIDELINES</b></p>
						<p>Cohesion. Consistency. Maintaining a level of value and excellence. </p>
						<p> These are reasons for creating an explicit standard with a full brand description of what that brand stands for. The use of specific colors, typographical elements, image styles and dimensions generates confidence with consistency of tone. A company’s vision is reflected in the handling of its brand; therefore, it is imperative to avoid discrepancies in brand elements. Effective use of brand expression avoids physical deviations from the true character of the brand, and reminds people that behind that brand is a company inviting confidence and trust. </p>

						<p class="title" ><b>STORY DEVELOPMENT</b></p>
						<p>Everyone likes a good story. Developing and sharing a company’s story and its service environment fortifies a brand, amplifies its strengths, and aids in reaching a target audience. The story, or plot, includes all services offered, and follows that service path from start to finish. Building a story identity, anecdotal or yarn-like in nature, helps commercialize products – resulting in increased customer loyalty.</p>

						<p class="title" ><b>VALUE PROPOSITION</b></p>
						<p>TIn short: Value = Benefits – Cost <br> A value proposition explains the benefits a company provides, and how it accomplishes that uniquely well. It describes the target buyer, the problem a product or service addresses, and provides a promise of value to be delivered. Why should someone buy a product or use a service? Based on a review and analysis of benefits, costs, and the value an organization can deliver, a value proposition summarizes value to be delivered.</p>
